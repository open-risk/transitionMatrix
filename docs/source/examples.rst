Usage Examples
======================

The examples directory includes both **standalone python scripts** and **jupyter notebooks** to help you get started. (NB: Currently there are more scripts than notebooks).

A selection of topics covered:

- Generating transition matrices from data (using various estimators)
- Manipulating transition matrices
- Computing and visualizing credit curves corresponding to a set of transition matrices
- Mapping rating states between different rating systems

Python Scripts
-------------------------------------------

The scripts are located in examples/python. For testing purposes all examples can be run using the run_examples.py script located in the root directory. Some scripts have an example flag that selects alternative input data or estimators.
