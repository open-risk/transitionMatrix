About transitionMatrix
======================

.. image:: ../../examples/overview.png

transitionMatrix is a pure Python powered library for the statistical analysis and visualization of state transition phenomena. It can be used to analyze any dataset that captures *timestamped transitions in a discrete state space.*

Use cases include applications in finance (for example credit rating transitions), IT (system state event logs) and more.

**NB: transitionMatrix is still in alpha release / active development. If you encounter issues please raise them in our
github repository**
